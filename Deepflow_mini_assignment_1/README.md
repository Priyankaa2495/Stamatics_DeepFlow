This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Zomato's restaurant data. The goal was to uncover meaningful insights about restaurant trends, cuisines, pricing, ratings, and location-based patterns using Python, pandas, and visualizationsâ€”assisted by GPT for cleaning and insight generation.

The dataset used is the Zomato Restaurants dataset. It contains details such as:
Restaurant names
Location and city
Cuisines served
Online delivery availability
Ratings and votes
Average cost for two
Types of services (Dine-out, Delivery, etc.)

Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing/null values, fix inconsistencies)

Analyze:
Most popular cuisines
City-wise restaurant distribution
Online delivery trends
Ratings vs cost relationships
Which features affect a restaurant's success

Use visualizations to understand data patterns
